# Online_News_Popularity

In today's digital age, online news has become an integral part of the day to day lives. With a click of a button, news articles can reach millions of readers worldwide, shaping opinions and influencing conversations. However, not all news stories are created equal when it comes to popularity and engagement. Some articles go viral, generating an avalanche of shares, comments, and views, while others remain largely unnoticed.

The ability to predict the popularity of online news articles has significant implications for content creators, media organizations, and digital marketers alike. By understanding the factors that contribute to an article's success, publishers can optimize their content strategy, enhance audience engagement, and ultimately maximize the reach and impact of their news stories.

The proliferation of smartphones and Internet connectivity has increased the number of news websites covering a wide range of issues, including politics, economics, business, entertainment, technology, fashion, and many more. This will be useful to online news organisations in gauging the interest in their stories before publication.

Academic studies frequently examine how to foresee the proliferation of internet news. User comments augment content analysis on the internet. It turns fame into a contest in which the winners are the days on which the most enticing stories were published. To classify how interesting a piece of internet news is, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to employ a ranking.
